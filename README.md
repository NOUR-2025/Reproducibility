# Reproducibility

In this repository, everyone will learn:

1. Working together in a collaborative environment via branching and pull requests.
2. Utilizing Anaconda and Python to create reproducibile environments to recreate and/or rerun other's Jupyter notebooks.
3. Independently learning how to use libraries such as pandas and seaborn.
4. The basics of data exploration.

To install Anaconda, please go to this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (you will need to make an account).

By the end, we will have a repository with everyone's Jupyter notebooks, their associated Python environments (in `environment.txt files), and their data explorations.
